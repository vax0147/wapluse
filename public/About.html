                <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Pluse CRM is a personal CRM designed to help you nurture your relationships, remember important details, and stay connected with the people who matter most. It's a web-based application providing intuitive tools for managing your personal and professional network.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-light">What will this app do with user data?</h2>
                <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Pluse CRM requests read-only access to your Google Contacts (<code>contacts.readonly</code>) and "Other contacts" (<code>contacts.other.readonly</code>). This data is used solely to **display your complete contact list** (including explicitly saved contacts and "Other contacts" from Gmail interactions) within your Pluse CRM dashboard.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    **Crucially, Pluse CRM does NOT store or retain any of your Google Contacts data (names, emails, phone numbers, etc.) on its servers.** All contact data is fetched in real-time from Google's API directly within your browser session.

                <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    By displaying your Google Contacts, Pluse CRM allows you to centralize your relationship management. You can add your own private notes, reminders, and interaction logs linked to these contacts. This enhances functionality by providing a comprehensive personal CRM experience without compromising your privacy, as only your self-generated content is stored securely on our servers, linked via the Google Contact ID.

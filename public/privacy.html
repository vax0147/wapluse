  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Updated:</strong> July 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Willi Afro Plus Customer Relationship Management Limited 
    (“WA Pluse CRM”), operated by Willi Afro Plus Customer Relationship Management Limited  
    (Business ID: 700829569666599), is committed to protecting your privacy. 
    This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data when you use our website and application. 
    We value transparency and want you to understand what we do with your information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use WA Pluse CRM, we may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Google account email and profile information (via OAuth)</li>
    <li>Your contact data from Google Contacts and other contents you have interacted with on Google that have been automatically saved by Google. (readonly access only)</li>
    <li>Notes, reminders, and manual interactions you create in the app</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage data for improving user experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your data solely to provide CRM features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying Google Contacts in your dashboard (we do not store your contact data)</li>
    <li>Letting you add private notes, reminders, and contact interactions (these are stored securely)</li>
    <li>Improving our service through aggregated, anonymous analytics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We request access to your Google Contacts using the <code>contacts.readonly</code> and <code>contacts.other.readonly</code> scopes. 
    This allows us to display your saved and “Other Contacts” directly in your dashboard without storing them on our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>4. How We Protect Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    We implement security measures such as HTTPS, encryption, and access control to protect your data. 
    OAuth data is only accessed using Google's secure APIs and never stored unless you explicitly save related content (like notes).
  </p>

  <h2>5. What We Don't Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not store or retain your Google Contacts or Other Contacts</li>
    <li>We do not sell your data</li>
    <li>We do not serve ads based on your personal data</li>
    <li>We do not access Gmail or calendar data</li>
    <li>We do not use your Google data to train any AI models</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Managing Your Data and Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    You can revoke WA Pluse CRM's access to your Google account at any time through your Google Account settings:<br />
    <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/connections?filters=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      https://myaccount.google.com/connections?filters=2
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you choose to disconnect your Google account or delete your WA Pluse CRM account, 
    we immediately revoke both the <strong>Google access token</strong> and <strong>Google refresh token</strong> 
    using Google's secure OAuth2 revocation API. This ensures our application is fully disconnected from your Google data.
  </p>
  <p>
    We implement this revocation automatically from our backend and remove all OAuth tokens and associated credentials from our database. 
    This action is triggered as part of the account deletion or disconnection process, and takes effect within seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
    To delete your account and associated notes/reminders, visit the "Settings" page in your dashboard.
  </p>
